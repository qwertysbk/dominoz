	    <h1 id="p2">About Dominoz</h1>
		<p><em>&gt2&lt</em> Dominoz was founded by Mahatma Gandhi, an entrepreneur who began selling pizza from his roadside restaurant in ITPL,Bengaluru , before his death. Modi identified the potential of the restaurant franchising concept and the first "Dominoz" franchise opened in K R Puram in 1999. Dominoz popularized Pizza in the fast-food industry, diversifying the market by challenging the established dominance of the hamburger and KFC. By branding himself as "DOMI-KNOWS", Shah Rukh Khan became a prominent figure of Desi cultural history and his image remains widely used in Dominoz advertising to this day. However, the company's rapid expansion overwhelmed the aging Christiano Ronaldo and he sold it to a group of investors led by Mr.SBK.
		however later it was taken over by Virat Kohli and Rocky Bhai</p>
